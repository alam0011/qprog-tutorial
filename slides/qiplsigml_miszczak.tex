\subsection{Typical approach}

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}{\insertsubsection}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item embedded domain specific language $\rightarrow$ C/Python/Wolfram with library
		\item data abstraction $\rightarrow$ allocation of classical and quantum registers based on qu(b$|$d)its
		\item quantum functions $\rightarrow$ custom elementary gates defined by matrices or compound statements
		\item classical control of quantum memory $\rightarrow$ by using host language
