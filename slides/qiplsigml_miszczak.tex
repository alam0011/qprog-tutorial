\subsection{What is quantum programming?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{\insertsection}{\insertsubsection}
    
\emph{Quantum programming is a process that leads from an 
original formulation of a computing problem to executable quantum computer 
programs.}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{\insertsection}{\insertsubsection}

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item<1-> \emph{The only way to learn a new quantum programming language is 
    by writing programs in it.}

    \item<2-> \emph{The process of preparing programs for a quantum computer is 
    especially attractive because it not only can be economically and 
    scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like 
    composing poetry or music.}

    \item<3-> \emph{Only the modern quantum computer has made quantum 
    programming both challenging and relevant.}

        \item<1-> Use real quantum computers. 
        \item<2-> Play with quantum mechanics.
        \item<3-> Stretch your imagination by creating a new programming 
        language with quantum elements...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}{\insertsubsection}
    You already know that
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> quantum states are just vectors (at least we would like them 
        to 
        be)
        \item<2-> ...quantum gates are just matrices (at most $4\times 4$, and 
        don't mention the decoherence)...
        \item<3-> ...only the final step is somehow strange.
        \item<4->{\emph{Real Programmers do Quantum Computing in FORTRAN.}}
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}{\insertsubsection}
For example, in Julia... \\[12pt] \only<2->{Examples in 
Wolfram can be found in the GitHub repo}

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}{\insertsubsection}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<1-> Actually this is almost as good as it gets!
        \item<2-> Because...
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<3->  ...you already know the language.
            \item<4-> ...it is very easy to implement 
            classical control.
            \item<5-> ...it is relatively easy to take into account effects of 
            decoherence.
        \end{itemize}
        \item<6-> Missing: the memory management.
        \item<7-> And in most cases you don't need all the power/libraries/etc 
        coming with the host language.
