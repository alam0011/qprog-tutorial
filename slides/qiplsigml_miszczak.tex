  \begin{itemize}
    \item Level 0: Direct usage of quantum gates
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Visual manipulation of gates and circuits (eg. IBM Q 
            Experience \url{https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx})
            \item Multiplication of matrices and vectors (eg. QuantumOctave 
            \url{https://github.com/ZKSI/quantum-octave}, Qi 
            \url{https://iitis.pl/~miszczak/qi.php})
        \end{itemize}

    \item Level 1: Embedded language with data abstraction (eg. 
    \textbf{ProjectQ}, Rigetti pyQuil, Quipper 
    \url{https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/})
    
    \item Level 2: Domain specific language with data and function abstraction

  \end{itemize}
