\begin{itemize}
%    \item<1-> \emph{Quantum programming is a process that leads from an 
%    original formulation of a computing problem to executable quantum computer 
%    programs.}
%    \item<2-> \emph{The act of incorporating such instruction sequences
%    into "recipes" representing certain classes of computational processes is
%    called quantum programming.}
    \item<1-> \emph{The process of preparing programs for a quantum computer is 
    especially attractive because it not only can be economically and 
    scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like 
    composing poetry or music.}
    \item<2-> \emph{The only way to learn a new quantum programming language is 
    by writing programs in it.}
    \item<3-> \emph{Only the modern quantum computer has made quantum 
    programming both challenging and relevant.}
