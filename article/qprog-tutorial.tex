\begin{abstract}
The aim of this \docName is to provide basic information about quantum
programming languages and methods of developing programs running on quantum
computers. We focus on the procedural approach by presenting implementation
of selected quantum algorithms and protocols using various programming
languages. We review the recent software developed for accessing commercial
quantum computers.\\[6pt]

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Recent progress in the field of quantum technologies~\cite{gyongyosi2019survey} 
and computation promises the increasing availability of quantum 
computing 
resources in near future. In particular, during the last few year new 
computing platforms have been developed by many 
companies~\cite{ibm-quantumexperience}. This resulted in many intersting 
application of the available quantum hardware~\cite{xandu-pennylane}. 
However, to utilized quantum computers for solving real-world problems 
efficiently it is necessary to develop software tools---quantum programming 
languages and compilers targeting hardware platforms---which will support the 
development of quantum software and take into account the limitation of the 
available hardware~\cite{chong2017programming}. It is also worth noting that 
with the increasing number of hardware platforms, the end-users are offered 
many software platforms for accessing the quantum 
machines~\cite{larose2018overview}, each with its own features and limitations.

Commercial availability of quantum computer induced rapid development of new 
frameworks and programming tools required for harnessing quantum machines. 
The goal of this \docName is to introduce basic elements utilized by quantum 
computing frameworks developed for the purpose of programming existing and 
near-term quantum  computers~\cite{preskill2018quantum,ibm-qiskit-aqua}. We 
approach this topic in three steps. In the first level we demonstrate how 
high-level quantum computing can be describe with a little help form standard 
computer algebra tools. The basic formulation of quantum computing can be 
generalized by developing domain-specific language emended into a general 
purpose programming languages. Code examples discussed in this \docName are 
available for download from~\cite{qprog-tutor}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{What is quantum programming?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Quantum programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a 
computing problem to executable quantum computer programs.

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{The only way to learn a new quantum programming language is 
    by writing programs in it.}

\item \emph{The process of preparing programs for a quantum computer is 
    especially attractive because it not only can be economically and 
    scientifically rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like 
    composing poetry or music.}

\item \emph{Only the modern quantum computer has made quantum 
    programming both challenging and relevant.}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Advantages of quantum programming}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
    \item Use real quantum computers. 
    \item Play with quantum mechanics.
    \item Stretch your imagination by creating a new programming 
    language with quantum elements...
    \item ...or a language for describing quantum mechanics.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{How to do quantum programming?}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Level 0: Manipulation of quantum gates.
    Visual manipulation of gates and circuits or multiplication 
        of matrices and vectors
    
    \item Level 1: Programming QRAM. (Embedded language 
        with data abstraction and classical control of quantum memory)
    
    \item Level 2: High-level programming. (Domain specific 
        language with data and function abstraction.)
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Level 0: Direct usage of quantum gates.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize}
\item Visual manipulation of gates and circuits.
\item Multiplication of matrices and vectors.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\end{figure}
     



\begin{itemize}
\item Direct manipulation of quantum gates, measurement.
\item Integration with text-based description of circuits: QASM 
(IBM Q) or C\texttt{\#} (QuIDE).
\item Useful for testing small circuits.
\item Not so much for real algorithms.
\item You have to live with connectivity limitations (IBM Q).
\item But you can use a real quantum computer!
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Alternative approach: Manipulation of vectors and matrices}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

You already know that
\begin{itemize}
    \item quantum states are just vectors (at least we would like them 
    to 
    be)
    \item ...quantum gates are just matrices (at most $4\times 4$, and 
    don't mention the decoherence)...
    \item ...only the final step is somehow strange.
    \item{\emph{Real Programmers do Quantum Computing in FORTRAN.}}
\end{itemize}


For example, in Julia... \\[12pt] 


\todo{Include Julia code}

\todo{Examples in Wolfram can be found in the GitHub repo}


\begin{itemize}
\item Actually this is almost as good as it gets!
\item Because...
\begin{itemize}
\item ...you already know the language.
\item ...it is very easy to implement 
classical control.
\item ...it is relatively easy to take into account effects of 
decoherence.
\end{itemize}
\item Missing: the memory management.
\item And in most cases you don't need all the power/libraries/etc 
coming with the host language.
\end{itemize}
